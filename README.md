Snakes vs Blocks: A game made exclusively on JAVA

Player uses arrow keys to control a snake (made of brightly colored balls). 
The player can make the snake longer by running over more balls.
The number above the ball determines how much longer the snake will get. 
If the player’s snake hits a block, however, the snake will get shorter. 
The number on the block determines how much shorter the snake will get.
If the player hits a block with a 24 written on it, the player’s snake will get 24 balls shorter. 
The goal is for the player to go as long as possible without running out of snake.
When the snake runs out of balls, the game is over.
